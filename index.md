Welcome to the ORCiD Endorsement Test site! This is a demonstration of a complete endorsement system for scientific proposals using ORCiD authentication.

## Current Proposal

We're seeking community support for a groundbreaking neutron scattering instrument proposal. Read about it and show your support!

👉 [Endorse this proposal](/endorsement/)

## About This System

This site demonstrates how to build a privacy-preserving endorsement system that:

- Uses **ORCiD** for secure authentication
- Collects verifiable support from researchers
- Displays **aggregate statistics** without exposing individual identities
- Runs on a **serverless architecture** (Cloudflare Workers + GitHub Pages)

Learn more on the [About page](/about/) or check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/g5t/orcid-endorsement-test).

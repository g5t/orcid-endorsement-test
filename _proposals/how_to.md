## Important Information About Your Data

When you endorse a proposal, we collect information from your public ORCiD profile. You can remove your endorsement **at any time before the proposal is submitted** for funding. However, once a proposal is submitted to a funding agency, your information becomes part of the official application and cannot be removed from that specific submission.

For complete details, please read our [Privacy Policy]({{ '/privacy/' | relative_url }}).

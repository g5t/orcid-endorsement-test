## Executive Summary

We propose the development of a next-generation neutron scattering instrument that will enable groundbreaking research in materials science, biology, and condensed matter physics.

## Background

Neutron scattering is a powerful technique for studying the structure and dynamics of materials at the atomic and molecular level. Current instruments, while capable, face limitations in:

- **Resolution**: Limited ability to resolve fine structural details
- **Throughput**: Long measurement times for complex samples
- **Accessibility**: High barriers to entry for new researchers

## Proposed Solution

Our proposal addresses these challenges through:

### 1. Advanced Detector Technology

Implementation of next-generation detectors with:
- 10x improved sensitivity
- Faster readout times
- Lower background noise

### 2. Optimized Beamline Design

A revolutionary beamline configuration featuring:
- Enhanced focusing optics
- Adaptive sample environment
- Real-time data processing

### 3. Open Access Program

To maximize scientific impact, we will:
- Provide subsidized beam time for early-career researchers
- Develop comprehensive training programs
- Create open-source analysis software

## Expected Impact

This instrument will enable:

- **Materials Science**: Understanding of quantum materials and superconductors
- **Structural Biology**: Detailed studies of protein dynamics and membrane structures
- **Energy Research**: Development of better batteries and fuel cells
- **Fundamental Physics**: Investigation of magnetic phenomena and phase transitions

## Timeline and Budget

- **Phase 1** (Years 1-2): Design and procurement - $5M
- **Phase 2** (Years 3-4): Construction and commissioning - $8M
- **Phase 3** (Year 5): First experiments and optimization - $2M

**Total Budget**: $15 million over 5 years

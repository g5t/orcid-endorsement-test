## Executive Summary

We are excited to present a proposal for a groundbreaking neutron scattering instrument that will revolutionize materials characterization and advance our understanding of complex materials at the atomic and molecular scale. This next-generation facility combines unprecedented resolution with enhanced flux capabilities, opening new frontiers in materials science, biology, and fundamental physics research.

## Scientific Motivation

Neutron scattering has long been an indispensable tool for probing the structure and dynamics of matter. Unlike X-rays, neutrons are sensitive to light elements, magnetic moments, and can penetrate deep into bulk samples without causing damage. However, current instruments face limitations in flux, resolution, and simultaneous coverage of momentum-energy space. Our proposed instrument addresses these challenges head-on.

The scientific community urgently needs improved capabilities for studying:

- **Quantum materials** exhibiting exotic phenomena like high-temperature superconductivity and topological phases
- **Energy materials** including batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage systems
- **Biological systems** such as protein dynamics and membrane structures
- **Magnetic materials** for next-generation data storage and quantum computing
- **Soft matter** and complex fluids under realistic operational conditions

## Technical Innovation

### Advanced Guide System

Our instrument will feature a state-of-the-art neutron guide system utilizing supermirror technology with m=7 coating, providing a 50% increase in flux compared to conventional guides. The optimized guide geometry minimizes beam divergence while maximizing transmission efficiency across a broad wavelength range from 1.5 to 20 Angstroms.

### Multi-Analyzer Detection

The instrument incorporates a revolutionary multi-analyzer crystal array with 31 independent detector banks, each optimized for specific scattering angles. This configuration enables simultaneous measurement of multiple momentum transfers, reducing measurement time by an order of magnitude compared to conventional single-detector systems.

### Cryogenic Sample Environment

We will integrate a next-generation closed-cycle cryostat capable of reaching 300 mK with unprecedented temperature stability (±1 mK). Combined with high magnetic field capabilities (up to 9 Tesla), this enables exploration of quantum critical phenomena and exotic ground states in quantum materials.

### Intelligent Data Acquisition

The instrument will employ machine learning algorithms for real-time data optimization, automatically adjusting measurement parameters based on sample characteristics and desired information. This adaptive approach maximizes scientific output while minimizing beam time usage.

## Expected Impact

This instrument will serve a diverse user community spanning multiple disciplines:

1. **Materials Discovery**: Accelerate the discovery and optimization of novel materials for energy, computing, and healthcare applications
2. **Fundamental Physics**: Enable tests of quantum mechanics at mesoscopic scales and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model
3. **Industrial Applications**: Support development of better batteries, catalysts, polymers, and structural materials
4. **Training**: Provide state-of-the-art facilities for educating the next generation of neutron scatterers

We anticipate the instrument will support 200+ experiments per year, serving 500+ unique users from academia, national laboratories, and industry. The enhanced capabilities will enable experiments previously considered impossible, opening entirely new research directions.

## Executive Summary

We propose the development and adoption of universal open data standards for neutron scattering experiments to enhance reproducibility, enable data sharing, and accelerate scientific discovery.

## The Problem

The neutron scattering community faces significant challenges:

- **Data Fragmentation**: Each facility uses proprietary data formats
- **Limited Reproducibility**: Insufficient metadata makes it difficult to replicate experiments
- **Barriers to Collaboration**: Incompatible formats hinder multi-facility studies
- **Lost Knowledge**: Legacy data is often inaccessible due to format obsolescence

## Proposed Solution

We will develop comprehensive, community-driven data standards addressing:

### 1. Universal Data Format

- **NeXus Extension**: Build upon the existing NeXus standard
- **Rich Metadata**: Include experimental conditions, sample information, and instrument configuration
- **Self-Describing**: Data files contain all information needed for analysis
- **Future-Proof**: Based on HDF5 with long-term format stability

### 2. Standardized Workflows

- **Data Reduction**: Common procedures across facilities
- **Analysis Pipelines**: Reproducible computational workflows
- **Quality Metrics**: Standardized assessment of data quality

### 3. Open Repository

- **Central Archive**: Community repository for neutron scattering data
- **DOI Assignment**: Citable datasets with persistent identifiers
- **Easy Discovery**: Searchable metadata and faceted browsing
- **API Access**: Programmatic access for computational studies

## Benefits

### For Researchers

- Easier data sharing and collaboration
- Reduced time spent on format conversion
- Ability to reuse and combine datasets
- Enhanced reproducibility of results

### For Facilities

- Simplified data management
- Improved user support
- Better resource utilization
- Enhanced facility reputation

### For Science

- Accelerated discovery through data reuse
- Large-scale meta-analyses
- Machine learning applications
- Preservation of scientific heritage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Standards Development (Months 1-12)

- Community workshops and feedback sessions
- Technical specification development
- Pilot implementation at 3 facilities
- **Budget**: $500K

### Phase 2: Software Tools (Months 13-24)

- Conversion utilities for legacy data
- Analysis software updates
- Validation tools
- Documentation and tutorials
- **Budget**: $750K

### Phase 3: Repository Deployment (Months 25-36)

- Infrastructure setup
- Data ingestion pipelines
- User interface development
- Training programs
- **Budget**: $1M

**Total Budget**: $2.25 million over 3 years

## Community Engagement

Success requires broad community participation:

- **Steering Committee**: Representatives from major facilities
- **Working Groups**: Technical experts in specific areas
- **User Forum**: Open discussion platform
- **Annual Meetings**: Progress reviews and strategy sessions

## Sustainability

Long-term sustainability through:

- Facility consortium membership fees
- Integration with existing infrastructure
- National funding agency support
- Community governance model

## Expected Outcomes

Within 5 years:

- 80% of neutron facilities adopt the standard
- 10,000+ datasets in the open repository
- 50% reduction in data format conversion time
- 100+ publications using multi-facility datasets

# Test ORCiD Endorsement of Proposals

Welcome to the ORCiD Endorsement System!

> ### How it works
>
> - __Browse Proposals__ - Explore scientific proposals in our [blog]({{'/posts' | relative_url}})
> - __Decide to Endorse__ - When you agree with a concept and want to attach your name to a proposal
> - __Sign In with ORCiD__ - Use or create your researcher identifier, we will retrieve your id, name, job title, and employer from your public profile
> - __Endorse a Proposal__ - Show your support for proposals you believe in; though only in aggregate publicly.
> - __Manage your endorsements__ - View and optionally remove your proposal endorsements.
